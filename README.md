# toyhouse pages

various html work i've done for profile and characters pages on my [toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se/rubic) page.

nothing here will run alone -- i would generally work in Chrome's inspect element or a text editor to paste it into the toyhouse code editor, save changes, and reload a page.
